Hagiography Taken to Extremes, October 27, 2000

Reviewer: A reader from London, UK

If you are a Clapton fan and need 300 pages of reassurance that he is a a gifted musician, then put this book at the top of your shopping list. If, however, you are looking for an objective assessment of his life, career and impact as a musician you'll need to look elsewhere.

Clapton and Coleman were close friends and this book is essentially a 300-page french kiss, as most third-party "authorized biographies" are. It's hard to imagine a book with more postive editorializing adjectives per page (briliant, superb, amazing, stunning.)

Clapton's failed marriages are glossed over in a paragraph or so and his heroin addiction is treated like a valiant and ultimately positive "adventure." The author throws out all prentense of neutrality by the end of the first chapter.

Coleman is capable of superb work, as his definitive biography of John Lennon shows. One can only hope that someday someone will do a similar treatment of Clapton's life. This isn't it by a long stretch.

If you are in the market for a first-rate biography of a great guitarist, consider Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy.

one great book, November 1, 1999

Reviewer: Sonia from Northern Idaho

This book has it all from pictures to journal writings. This book tells about EC's struggles as a young boy in art school to his marriage and even about his drug habits. This book is number one in my book and always will. It is a must read.

The definitive biography of EC as a man., October 7, 1999

Reviewer: Virginia Lohle from New York City

Ray Coleman was granted amazing access to Eric, his family and friends. This is the best book on the market about Eric as a person. Roberty's books are more comprehensive about his music, but the late, great Melody Maker editor Ray Coleman knew and loved Eric for many years, and has rare insight.

As Good As It Gets-- This book is a Bible of this God's life, November 5, 1998

Reviewer: debslogan@email.msn.com from U.S.A.

This book will truly make any reader a devoted fan to the Rock world's answer to the Guitar Master. His life was more complex than the Blues stars he tried to imitate. From love triangles,addictions,career struggles,freindships and loyalties, Eric has gone through it all, and now he has finally been rewarded. After reading this book, you'll feel you've known him and want to know more!!!!!
